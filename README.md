# balanced-shield
A Minecraft Mod for Fabric that rebalances the shield. Use with the Guarding Mod for best results!
Fixes and balances the shield by adding a "shield tolerance" value that reduces as your shield takes hits.
If you haven't been taking hits in a while, your shield tolerance recharges.
This effectively allows sword users to disable an opponent's shield without needing to swap to an axe.
Fully or nearly full charged attacks will be effective against the opponent's sheild. Spam attacks will not work as well.
Arrows, explosions and fireworks will all reduce shield tolerance.
When Shield tolerance is at 0%, its disabled for a while.

Required client and server.

My Apollocheese for any incompatabilities this may have with other mods. This was my first mod.
